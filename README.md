============

Neural network agent predicting and simulating energy trade on the European energy market Nordpool Spot.

Program created as part of a course on artificial intelligence. The program isn't intended to become "finished" or made 
more robust, and is thus uploaded solely for my own convenience. No steps or instructions has been made to make the project
build more easily for the public, but feel free to use any of my code.

Following thirdparty libraries have been used:
